# Drake: A Guide to Sane and Modern Data Processing Workflows

## Synopsis

Drake is a data workflow tool which helps you bring sanity to your otherwise chaotic world of data processing. In terms of capabilities, Drake is an improvement to traditional approaches such as building your own workflow logic from scratch, or attempting to shoe-horn less-than-appropriate solutions like Make into your process. Drake allows you to organize your workflow command execution around data and its dependencies. Drake recognizes the common needs of the modern data processing world including polyglot programming, remote data, distributed teams, and agile development. Data processing steps are defined along with their inputs and outputs.  It automatically resolves dependencies and provides a rich set of options for controlling the workflow. It supports multiple inputs and outputs and has HDFS support built-in.

"Drake: A Guide" begins by introducing you to the concept of representing your data workflow as a simple text file, describing steps in terms of their inputs, outputs and implementation. It then offers further details on the essential features of Drake. You are encouraged to get your hands dirty and build real world, modern, flexible, maintainable and manageable data workflows that can be deployed to production.

You'll discover how Drake can help you:

* fully manage any data processing workflow
* achieve repeatability of your overall data building process
* precisely control which steps run, for more effective testing, debugging, shipping, etc.
* unify heterogenous tools in a single workflow (shell commands, Ruby, Python, Clojure, pushing data to production, etc.)
* extend your data workflow to solve your organization's modern and ever-changing business needs

In the end, you'll find yourself spending less time wrestling with your data processing workflow and more time working on your actual data processing.
